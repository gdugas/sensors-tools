[REQUIREMENTS]
linux file system with cron service, apache server (or other web server),
lm-sensors, php, sqlite3, python >= 2.6

After the install of lm-sensors, launch "sensors-detect" command and
answer to all question.

If "sensors" command works well and give some interesting results, you
can install the sensors-tools program.

To use www highchart, please check that you enable sqlite PDO driver in php.ini
You will find sqlite.so in php5-sqlite package on ubuntu.

/etc/php5/apache2/conf.d/pdo.ini (or [/etc/php5/apache2/]php.ini)
	extension=pdo.so
	extension=pdo_sqlite.so
	extension=sqlite.so


[INSTALL]
First launch install.py python script in root with
    
    # python install.py
    
or
   
$ sudo python install.py

Then, if you want to see chart on a web server, you have to create a symlinks
 in your www directory to map to the www subdirectory of sensor-tools here.
For example, with Apache and /var/www for document root (this is default configuration) :
cd /var/www
ln -s [YOUR_SENSORS_INSTALL_DIR]/www sensors
Where 'sensors' is the name of your symbolic link.

[CONFIGURATION]

First edit sensorsConf.py to map to your system and your preferences.
To know what device(s) you want to monitor, you can execute (from install directory) :
bin/sensors-xml
from sensors-tools install directory

You can add a treshold to email you for temperature alerts.

You could change the /etc/cron.d/sensors-tools file to save information every
N minutes (5 by default).
